# 💯 100 Days Frontend Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days Frontend Challenge** — a self-commitment to build 100 unique frontend components, UIs, or features over 100 days to level up my frontend development skills.

---

## 📌 Challenge Overview

- 🔥 **Goal:** Master **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** by building real-world UI elements without relying on external component libraries.
- 🧠 **Approach:** Learn by doing — one new concept, component, or UI interaction every single day.
- 🚫 **Rule:** No use of external UI or animation libraries (unless absolutely necessary). Focus is on **core logic**, **vanilla JS**, and **React** mastery.
