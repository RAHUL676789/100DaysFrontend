# 💯 100 Days Frontend Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days Frontend Challenge** — a self-commitment to build 100 unique frontend components, UIs, or features over 100 days to level up my frontend development skills.

---

## 📌 Challenge Overview

- 🔥 **Goal:** Master HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind by building real-world UI elements without relying on external component libraries.
- 🧠 **Approach:** Learn by doing — practice one new concept every day.
- 🚫 **Rule:** No use of external animation or UI libraries unless absolutely necessary. Focus is on writing clean, core logic using **vanilla JavaScript** and **React** only.
